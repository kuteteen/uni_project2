			<b>Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein:</b>
			<br><br>
			There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>
			And before the street begins,<br>
			And there the grass grows soft and white,<br>
			And there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>
			And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>
			To cool in the peppermint wind.<br>
			<br>
			Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>
			And the dark street winds and bends.<br>
			Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>
			We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
			And watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>
			To the place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
			<br>
			Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
			And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>
			For the children, they mark, and the children, they know<br>
			The place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
